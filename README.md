# CPE_MIDEXAM
1. Create a repository in your GitHub account and name it CPE_MIDEXAM. Clone the repository and do the following: 
  * Create an Ansible playbook that does the following with an input of a config.yaml file and arranged Inventory file:
  * Install and configure Elastic Stack in separate  hosts (Elastic Search, Kibana, Logstash)
  * Install Nagios in one host
  * Install Grafana,Prometheus and Influxdb in seperate hosts (Influxdb,Grafana,Prometheus)
  * Install Lamp Stack in separate hosts (Httpd + Php,Mariadb)
2. Document all the tasks here using MSWord. (When I say document, that means you need to show proof of all the activities, including creating screenshots, proper labeling, and explanations.) 
3. Document the push, and commit from the local repository to GitHub. 
4. Finally, paste also the link of your GitHub repository in the documentation.
